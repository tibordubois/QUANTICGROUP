Welcome to QBN's documentation!
===============================

Our primary goal was to construct a quantum circuit using Qiskit to represent Bayesian networks. The objective was to perform inference on this quantum circuit and compare its performance against classical Bayesian networks. Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether quantum methods offer any computational speedups or advantages over traditional classical approaches.

In this documentation, you will find comprehensive guides, reference materials, and insights into our implementation, experiments, and findings. We hope this will be a valuable resource for understanding the intersection of quantum computing and Bayesian networks.
